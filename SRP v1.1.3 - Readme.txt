Sky Reclamation Project (SRP) v1.1.3

------------------------------------


====================================

About the Sky Reclamation Project:

====================================


The Sky Reclamation Project (SRP) is a community patch to address bugs that remain in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky after the official patch v1.5.10. All game content with the core patch has been kept original wherever feasible. To ask a question or provide feedback, drop by the project discussion thread at the following URL:

http://www.gsc-game.com/main.php?t=community&s=forums&s_game_type=xr2&thm_page=1&thm_id=20140&page=1&sort=ASC&sec_id=22&lang=en


====================================

Is a new game required?

====================================


Yes.


====================================

Installation:

====================================


Before proceeding, ensure that your game is patched to version 1.5.10. If you are unsure of this, launch the game and check the lower left corner of the main menu. It should read: "ver. 1.5.10". Additionally, if playing the Steam version of the game, verify the integrity of your game cache before proceeding. Then:

1.) Extract the contents of the archive in which you found this readme to your Clear Sky root directory. The root directory is usually one of:

• C:\Program Files (x86)\Deep Silver\S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Clear Sky\       (Retail version)
• C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\stalker clear sky\     (Steam version)
• C:\GOG Games\S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky\                               (GOG version)

If you already have mods installed, you will need to merge the contents of any conflicting files - do not just overwrite pre-existing files.

2.) If you are using a widescreen display, overwrite the 'gamedata' folder that now exists in your Clear Sky root directory with the 'gamedata' folder located in the 'Widescreen Patch' folder. Otherwise, skip this step.

3.) Install any desired optional features by pasting into your Clear Sky root directory the contents of the folder named after the desired optional feature. Overwrite any pre-existing files and folders if prompted, unless they did not originate in the SRP, in which case you will need to manually merge the new files with the pre-existing ones.

To prevent conflicts, install any optional features desired from folder #1 before installing any from folder #2. The 'Prefilled Stashes' and 'Prefilled Randomized Stashes' features require a new game, but all other optional features can be installed at any point in the game. Note also that the 'Reduced Grenade Spam' feature will take full effect only after starting a new game, although it is safe to install at any time. Consult the documentation marked 'Optional Features' for information on each feature, including recommendations for players unsure of which features to use.


====================================

Uninstallation:

====================================


1.) Delete the 'gamedata' folder (and its contents) from your Clear Sky root directory.

2.) If you installed the optional 'Improved LuaJIT Library' and wish to remove it, navigate to the game's 'bin' folder and restore the original 'lua.JIT.1.1.4.dll' file from the 'SRP Original LuaJIT Backup' archive.

3.) If you installed the optional 'SweetFX v1.5.1' feature and wish to remove it, delete these files from the game's 'bin' folder: 'd3d9.dll', 'dxgi.dll', and 'injector.ini'. Then delete the following from the game's root directory: the 'SweetFX' folder, 'd3d9.fx', 'dxgi.fx', 'log.log', 'shader.fx', 'SweetFX_preset.txt', and 'SweetFX_settings.txt'.

4.) If you installed the optional 'User Configuration Patch' and wish to restore your pre-SRP user profile, navigate to your %PUBLIC%\Documents\STALKER-STCS\ directory, delete 'user.ltx', and reinstate the 'user.ltx.before_srp' file as your 'user.ltx' file by stripping away its '.before_srp' suffix.

+ Fixed the Dark Valley mercenary base tunnel detonating (i) prematurely if the player wanders behind the deserted factory before receiving the task to purge the base; (ii) after it should have already gone out of commission if the player enters the relevant space restrictor for the first time only after the reward dialog with Chekhov.
+ Fixed the issues where the Dark Valley entrance hold-up (i) could occur prematurely if the player enters the Dark Valley before being tasked with chasing Fang there and (ii) would happen even after the player has reached Freedom's base if the player did not speak to the outpost commander before doing so.

+ Fixed the Red Forest bridge lowering sequence becoming prematurely unlocked.
+ Fixed the issue where the stalker squad headed toward the Devilish Encampment in the Red Forest could, in rare circumstances, spawn right in front of the player.

+ Fixed the issue where submitting the item requested in a 'return item' task would not complete the task if the player possesses multiple units of the item when submitting it.

+ Fixed the issue where several varieties of weapon would not be properly identified as such when the player's inventory is checked for dialog availability purposes.
+ Fixed the issue where ammunition would not aggregate into full boxes in the inventory, making its transference to a container tedious and providing a profitable exploit for 'bring ammo' tasks.
+ Fixed the issue where non-scripted squads loaded from a savegame (as opposed to spawning into the Zone in the current game session) would not spawn inventory box items.
+ Fixed the wrong location-based multiplier being used to spawn faction equipment chest supplies for scripted squads loaded from a savegame (as opposed to spawning into the Zone in the current game session).

+ Fixed mutants not behaving aggressively on patrol paths linking them to attack-targets unless aggravated by an external force (e.g. the player).
+ Fixed the issues where (i) Chekhov, Lingov, and Sakharov would not be marked as important characters on the map and (ii) the Duty outpost commander at Agroprom would be flagged as an important character even after he has become functionally generic.
+ Fixed the mechanic specialization tooltip displaying 'none' for Aydar, Yar, and Thunderov, despite all of them having a specialization.

+ Deleted the duplicate supply box spawn at the Trailhead in the Swamp.
+ Moved the eastern Cordon-to-Garbage level changer in order to make the player less likely to accidentally walk into it.
+ Made both the inventory box in the Old Church at the Great Swamp and the downward-facing safe at the Yantar factory less tedious to access. Also spawned a wooden box underneath the former in order to prevent it from seeming to levitate.

+ Fixed the following issues with the dialogue of the stalker squad overlooking the Vehicle Station at the Cordon: (i) the dialogue option to hire the squad would be available even without sufficient player funds, (ii) no money would actually be taken from the player when hiring the squad, (iii) the dialogue option to hire the squad would remain available even after the squad has already been hired, and (iv) the player could hire the squad even after already having dealt with the military presence at the Vehicle Station without the stalker squad's assistance.
+ Fixed the Uncle Yar dialog succeeding the completion of the night bloodsucker task where the player could reply to Yar's greeting only with a prompt "bye", making it impossible to e.g. submit flash drives to him.
+ Fixed the issues with the Professor Sakharov dialog where (i) he would ask the player to go see Lefty even after the player has restarted the cooling device, (ii) the player could ask for information about zombie attacks even after perpetually terminating them, and (iii) the player could ask about Lefty even before learning of him.

+ Fixed Father Valerian's invitation to join the stalkers playing on top of Sidorovich's 'thank you' audio upon returning the latter his case with the loot.

====================================

Advice / good to know:

====================================


• Frequently make hard-saves through the main menu and avoid relying on the quick-save feature — it is less reliable than hard-saving.

• A potentially more reliable alternative to the quick-save feature is to enter the main menu and press the 'S' key to create a quick named savegame from the currently active game session.

• Make a separate named savegame before entering Limansk; you will not be able to return to the earlier levels upon entering it until in freeplay mode.

• Keep the key bound to the 'use' command pressed down when approaching corpses to display the names of any tossed weapons in the vicinity.

• Double-clicking usable inventory items is a convenient shortcut to right-clicking them and selecting 'use this' from the droplist.

• Pressing the 'SHIFT' key is a convenient shortcut to take everything from a container or corpse when the inventory screen is open.

• Press the key bound to the 'order to attack' command (default: 'K') to order a nearby friendly squad, currently on standby, to attack.

• Unload the magazines of any weapons you have looted before selling them: contained ammo does not get factored into the selling price.

• Since SRP v1.0.4, saving the game refreshes the 'bring item' task available through any NPC set to offer such tasks for whom the player has not completed such a task during the preceding 24 game-hours.

• Hide/restore the HUD from the main menu using the 'F3'/'F4' keys, respectively. Scar will be impervious to damage and fatigue while the HUD is hidden, yielding a sort of 'god mode'.

• Quick-quit the game conveniently at any time by entering the main menu and then pressing the 'Q' key.


====================================

Troubleshooting:

====================================


Problems running the game? Ensure:

 • Your computer meets all the hardware requirements.
 • Your device drivers are up to date.
 • Your game is patched to version 1.5.10.
 • You have validated your game cache if running the Steam version of the game.
 • Your anti-virus software is not blocking the game from running.
 • You are running the game with administrator privileges. If you are not sure whether this is so, navigate to your Clear Sky root directory, open the 'bin' folder, right-click xrEngine.exe, and select 'Properties'. In the 'Compatibility' tab, check the box next to 'Run this program as an administrator', and then accept the changes. If this is not an option, refer to:

  https://www.gog.com/forum/stalker_series/how_do_you_run_the_game_without_admin_rights/post7

 • You have shut down all unnecessary applications before running the game. This includes monitoring utilities / overlays like MSI Afterburner and the Steam overlay.
 • You have installed the SRP correctly and are not running any other modifications --OR-- you are confident that your other modifications are merged correctly with the SRP and that they do not cause instability.

Unable to select DX10/10.1 mode in the graphics settings menu?

 • Uninstall SweetFX if you have it installed — it is known to disable DX10/10.1 support on some configurations.

Trying to run the game in DX10/10.1 mode? Getting intermittent freezes? Possible solutions:

 • Disable anti-aliasing in the game's graphics settings. It has been correlated to intermittent freezing in DX10/10.1 mode on Windows 7 64-bit with 'Update for Microsoft Windows (KB2670838)' installed.
 • Switch to DX9 mode.
 • Uninstall 'Update for Microsoft Windows (KB2670838)' if you have it installed — it is known to cause problems with Clear Sky. But beware that uninstalling it may have undesirable consequences for other applications on your PC. Research first.

Still have trouble?

 • Lower your graphical settings to the minimum, either from the main menu or manually via the user.ltx file located in your %PUBLIC%\Documents\STALKER-STCS\ folder. (See http://www.tweakguides.com/ClearSky_7.html for details on the latter method.) If that helps, you can begin raising the settings one-by-one until you pin-point the problematic setting. Then simply use a value for it that works.

If the steps above do not resolve your issue, make a post on the official GSC forum, here: http://www.gsc-game.com/main.php?t=community&s=forums&s_game_type=xr2&sec_id=19. The forum members are very helpful and knowledgeable and will usually reply within a day or two. You can hasten the process by quoting the last few lines of your crash log if you have one - this will usually be located inside a compressed folder in %AppData%\XRay Engine\reports\ and will be named 'xray_<Yourname>.log'. You can also quote the lines between 'Error Reason:' and 'Registers:' in 'errorlog.log', located in the same folder.


====================================

Bugs still in the game:

====================================


• Strelok can fall off a platform at the NPP, making the game unfinishable.
• Emissions may rarely break active tasks and NPC logic.
• NPCs may occasionally get stuck in an unresponsive state.
• Artifacts sometimes glitch into terrain, making them unattainable.
• Weapon scope zoom upgrades are 'forgotten' when another upgrade is installed over them, or when the player reloads a savegame - the new scope zoom value does not persist.
• The AI of the military NPCs at the Cordon outpost sometimes becomes unresponsive.
• Ambient music sometimes cuts off or fails to loop until the player creates or loads a savegame.
• It is sometimes possible to talk to hostile NPCs.
• The reload animation for shotguns sometimes glitches and shows the wrong number of shells being loaded into the shotgun.
• The player's nightvision gets disabled when a new suit of armor enters the player's inventory.
• The player's character model reverts back to the default leather jacket model upon picking up another suit.
• Bullet tracers may be visible through geometry on some hardware in DX10/10.1 mode with in-game anti-aliasing enabled. Disable in-game anti-aliasing and restart the game to work around this.
• Attempting to quit the game from the main menu can freeze the game on some hardware in DX10/10.1 mode.
• Controller psy-aura sounds playing before a savegame is loaded persist into that savegame. Restart the game before loading to work around this.
• Entries made to the PDA message log persist into a subsequently loaded savegame until overwritten by a new entry. Restart the game before loading to work around this.
• A squad NPC will issue squad audio prompts even if he is the sole member of the squad.
• Grenades sometimes become non-equippable. To work around this, drop one and pick it up again.
• Scar's avatar in the inventory screen may occasionally turn a red hue for no obvious reason. Restart the game to fix this.
• Forester's animation transitions are sometimes jerky.
• The trader in the Red Forest mine often levitates in the air beside his stool in a sitting position rather than being positioned on the stool itself. This is an SRP v1.0.4 regression.
• Upon entering the Dark Valley to find Fang and receiving the task to speak to the outpost commander, the mission marker on the map will always point to the north-western entrance of the Dark Valley, even if the player entered through the south-west and should therefore speak to the south-western commander.
• The emission timer text is wonky - the tooltip might display 5 hr. even when the map spot says that 21 minutes remain until an emission.
• Weapon attachment icons on primary weapons are misaligned in the inventory slot in widescreen mode.
• Graphical artifacts may appear when it rains. Restart the game to work around this.
• There are minor geometry glitches on some levels, e.g. floating reeds, trees, terrain objects, etc.
• The wet surfaces effect still does not work exactly as it should: when it is raining, (i) static stripes may appear on some surfaces (e.g. posters) fastened to an interior wall; (ii) rain may appear to pour down some interior walls; and (iii) grass / shrubbery may take on a metallic hue under some lighting conditions.
• Volumetric smoke may not appear properly or at all on some DX10-capable hardware.
• Skyboxes are visible through terrain when there is sufficient fog between the player and the terrain. The effect increases in prominence with fog density and the player's distance from the terrain.
• Hugging the wall next to Forester from the other side triggers his greeting audio due to an imprecisely aligned space restrictor.
• Attempting to exit the game while an NPC's death animation is in progress crashes the game:

• At least one possible waypoint crash remains in the game:

  FATAL ERROR

  [error]Expression    : vertex || show_restrictions(m_object)
  [error]Function      : CPatrolPathManager::select_point

  [error]Description   : any vertex in patrol path [red_smart_terrain_6_3_artefact_walker_1_walk] is inaccessible for object [sim_default_stalker_32778]

• Dying in an anomaly can occasionally crash the game:

  stack trace:

  0023:0603B4B0 xrGame.dll

  [error][       8]    : Not enough storage is available to process this command.
