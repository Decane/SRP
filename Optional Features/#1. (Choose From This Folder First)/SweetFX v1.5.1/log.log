If you have installed SweetFX correctly and have run the game with this log.log file in the same folder
as the game .exe and the d3d9.dll and dxgi.dll files, then it should be overwritten with debug information.

So if you have done that and you are reading this, then your game likely crashed because it couldn't write to this file.

Some steps to resolve this:
1) Check that this file is in the same folder as the game .exe and the d3d9.dll and dxgi.dll files.
   It's installed there per default so it should be there.

   If you moved the .dll's that came with SweetFX to another folder then check in that folder for the correct log.log,
   that the injector creates when it runs

2) Find out if it's a problem with insufficient user permissions in the game folder you installed SweetFX to.
   To do that try running the game with administrator rights by right-clicking it's exe and choosing "Run as administrator"
   If that worked then you have found the problem.

   To solve it, you can either keep running it as administrator everything, which can be a little annoying in the long run.

   You can also right click on the folder that contains this file and then choose "Properties"
   From there click "Security", then "Edit", then on your username, and then set "Full Control" to "Allow"
   This should also allow Modify, Execute, List, Read and Write - if it doesn't then also set thoose to "Allow"
   Now "OK" your way out of the dialogs.
   Your user account now has full control for that folder and you don't have to Run as administrator.

   Alternatively you can create a new shortcut to the game and right click that and choose "Properties"
   Under "Shortcut" click Advanced and check "Run as administrator" and "OK" your way out.
   This shortcut will now always run as administrator and the administrator account always has the necessary rights.

3) Does it still crash?
   Try disabling all game overlays (like Origin), recording software (like Fraps), framerate displaying software (like Fraps),
   GPU overclocking and tweaking software software and other d3d9.dll or dxgi.dll proxy dlls (like ENB, Helix or Umod)


4) If the above doesn't work and you can't solve the problem yourself or google your way to a solution then try to get support
   online in either the SweetFX thread on Guru3d or your preferred forum.
   Note that I prefer not to get support questions as PM's but I'd rather have you post in the thread so others can help you too.
   I'm not always in the thread but there is usually always other users.
