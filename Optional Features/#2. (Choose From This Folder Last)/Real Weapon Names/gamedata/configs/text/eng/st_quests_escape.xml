	<string id="esc_recover_item_1_text">
		<text>There used to be a chemist here in the Zone. He wasn’t a real chemist or anything but he made a “magic” vodka. It really was something… A couple of swigs and you’d forget everything: the Zone, mutants, anomalies - everything! Your fears left you and you didn’t give a shit about who you were or what was happening to you. Even at the price they used to charge for that stuff, it was still worth it. Anyway, one day someone decided to poison the chemist out of jealousy or greed, who knows? They poisoned him and that put an end to the vodka supplies… But, I heard the chemist had a few stashes around the Zone and I know where one is. Bring me a bottle of that magic stuff and I’ll pay you handsomely for it!</text>

		<text>I collect rare weapons, buddy - I’ve got enough of them to fill a museum, but if there’s one thing I’m missing that’s a trophy AKS-74. That AK is not just a good shooter, it’s a real rare piece that was used to kill mutants you ain’t never seen. I heard its owner was not only a great shot, he was a legend in the Zone who could get out of any trouble and escape any anomaly… I haven’t heard anything about that stalker for a while but I recently got some info about the shooter: it’s hidden in a secret place that’s pretty tough to get to.

		<text>Merc, an old friend of mine recently escaped the bandits at the Garbage. Those bastards made him run between anomalies at the embankment just for their amusement and the radiation levels around there are close to lethal. He can barely move now and normal rad meds are no use - he needs something stronger. I heard the army boys have special medkits that can help, so if you can get me one of those, we’d be tangibly grateful.</text>
