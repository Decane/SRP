------------------------------------

[1139] <deleted>

• Superfluous space restrictor: 'mar_space_restrictor_tut_boars'. Not referenced anywhere in the game code.

------------------------------------

[1184] <deleted>

• Superfluous space restrictor: 'mar_space_restrictor_start_sim'. Not referenced anywhere in the game code. The logic it binds is handled elsewhere in the SRP, rendering it obsolete.

------------------------------------

[1235] <deleted>

• Duplicate section: 'mar_physic_destroyable_object_0028'. Identical to 'mar_physic_destroyable_object_0027' of [1234] above it. This alteration resolves the issue with the duplicate supply box spawn at the back of the UAZ-469 at the Trailhead.

------------------------------------

[1403]

name = mar_csky_tactic

object_flags = 0xffffff3b

• Automatically made by the compiler (ACDC) to any spawn section belonging to the 'inventory_box' class.

------------------------------------

[1547] <deleted>

• Superfluous space restrictor: 'gar_space_restrictor_killer_pseudodogs'. Binds gar_space_restrictor_killer_pseudodogs.ltx, the condlist of whose initial active section references an info portion which is never supplied: 'gar_quest_killer_pseudodogs_started'. Remnant of a cut quest.

------------------------------------

[1548] <deleted>

• Superfluous space restrictor: 'gar_space_restrictor_killer_pseudodogs_forest_spawn_point'. Binds gar_space_restrictor_killer_pseudodogs_forest_spawn_point.ltx, the condlist of whose initial active section references an info portion which is never supplied: 'gar_quest_killer_pseudodogs_started'. Remnant of a cut quest.

------------------------------------

[2608]

object_flags = 0xffffffbf

• Automatically made by the compiler (ACDC).

------------------------------------

[2617] <deleted>

• This is the trip-wire in the basement of the Flea Market: 'gar_zone_mine_field_no_damage'. In vanilla, it is deleted (by its story ID, 700) in section '[sr_idle@unconscious_talk_4_time]' of gar_space_restrictor_fang_pda_cellar.ltx after it has served its purpose. This sometimes corrupts the game. In the SRP, the explosion is simulated with effectors to avoid the need to delete the trip-wire, or indeed to spawn it.

------------------------------------

[2758]

sim_avail = {=actor_in_stalker =is_stalker_at_expansion_4_or_higher} true, {-gar_story_searched_digger_body} false, {+gar_quest_get_old_pda_started -gar_quest_bring_old_pda_started} false, true

• Made the Treasure hunters’ camp available for entry by squads whenever the player is in the stalker faction and the stalkers are trying to capture the Depot, regardless of storyline progress, to resolve the issue where this camp becomes a bottleneck to faction war progress.

------------------------------------

[2765]

• Deleted duplicate 'surge_hide_avaliable = true' entry.

------------------------------------

[2769]

• Deleted duplicate 'surge_hide_avaliable = true' entry.

------------------------------------

[3012] <deleted>

• Superfluous space restrictor: 'esc_space_restrictor_scene1'. Not referenced anywhere in the game code. Binds esc_space_restrictor_enter.ltx whose sole function is to supply the info portion 'esc_actor_inside' upon the player entering the space restrictor. This info portion is referenced in a condlist in and only in esc_smart_terrain_6_8_spawn_restr.ltx, but the active section logic for that file is nil so the info portion is never actually used for anything.

[3014]

• Superfluous space restrictor: 'esc_space_restrictor_trader_last'. Not referenced anywhere in the game code.

------------------------------------

[3025]

custom_data = <<END
[dont_spawn_loot]

• Added section '[dont_spawn_loot]' to prevent the spawning of grenades, ammo, etc. on Lambee when his corpse is checked: if you give him a pistol and he drains the magazine before dying and flees as a result, it makes little sense for ammo to spawn on his corpse as if he still had ammo left after all.

------------------------------------

------------------------------------

[3066] <deleted>

• Superfluous space restrictor: 'esc_space_restrictor_reach_trader'. Not referenced anywhere in the game code and its script logic's sole function is to supply the info portion 'esc_actor_comes_2_trader' upon the player entering the space restrictor, but this info portion is never actually used for anything.

• Superfluous space restrictor: 'esc_space_restrictor_red_line'. Not referenced anywhere in the game code and its script logic's sole function is to supply the info portion 'esc_actor_near_mill' upon the player entering the space restrictor, but this info portion is never actually used for anything.

------------------------------------

[3074] <deleted>

• Superfluous space restrictor: 'esc_stalker_patrol_2_sound'. Not referenced anywhere in the game code and its script logic binding is commented out by default.

------------------------------------

[3076] <deleted>

• Superfluous space restrictor: 'esc_space_restrictor_patrol_zastava'. Not referenced anywhere in the game code.

[3166]

position = 29.7800006866455,16.2700004577637,686.880004882813

• This is the north-eastern level changer to the Garbage: 'esc_level_changer_to_garbage_1'. It has been moved to emulate its SoC location in order to prevent the player from accidentally walking into it.

------------------------------------

[3167] <deleted>

• Superfluous space restrictor: 'esc_trader_bye_give_habar'. Binds and is referenced in and only in esc_trader_bye_give_habar.ltx whose sole function is to play an angry sound upon the player leaving Sid's bunker without returning him his loot after picking it up. The handling of this prompt has instead been moved directly into Sid's script logic since SRP v1.0.3.

------------------------------------

[3243] <deleted>

• Superfluous space restrictor: 'esc_quest_additional_line_4'. Not referenced anywhere in the game code. Binds esc_quest_additional_line_4.ltx, the condlist of whose initial active section references an info portion which is never supplied, nor even defined: 'esc_mechanic_flash_card_1'. Remnant of a cut quest.

------------------------------------

[3246] <deleted>

• Superfluous space restrictor: 'esc_trader_tradezone'. Not referenced anywhere in the game code.

------------------------------------

[3272] <deleted>

------------------------------------

[4375]

sim_avail = {+esc_mission_stalker_leader_complete} true, {-esc_actor_mission_stalker_leader} true

• Added support for the stalker squad on the hill overlooking the car park to raid the car park immediately upon payment.

on_actor_inside2 = {-esc_actor_inside_traders_dung -esc_warnings_off} %+esc_warnings_off%

• The info portion 'esc_warnings_off' is utilized in and only in esc_stalker_bridge_logic.ltx and esc_stalker_tonnel_logic.ltx for the purpose of preventing the stalker territory guards from threatening the player and turning hostile if the player approaches them from behind after entering the Cordon through the northern Swamp-to-Cordon level changer. Squad disposition is here handled with the help of info portions because function xr_effects.set_squad_goodwill() will not alter the disposition of any squad NPCs that are not yet in db.storage and there is a chance of either the tunnel squad NPCs or the bridge squads' NPCs not being there when the function is called, e.g. if the player has not yet gone within the switch distance of the relevant squad NPCs when the function is called. The info portion 'esc_came_from_north' is utilized for the correct functioning of the military outpost machine gunner in case the player approaches the outpost for the first time from the north.
